Hi Jess,

The Diploma doesn't require any practical component to complete.

I believe the only way to continue working one day a week would be on a Saturday in a part-time position.

Thank you

Jill

Hi Jill,



Of course.



I will liaise with Debbie today to get the last of your courses booked in.



Does the Diploma of Business still mean you will continue working with us 1 day a week next year?



Speak soon

Jess

Subject: Completion of Cert III 2019



Hi Jess,



I have recently spoken with my schools' program leader, Mrs Anna Webb, regarding an opportunity to undertake a Diploma of Business.



A pre-requisite to commencing this course in February 2020 is to finish my Cert III by the end of this year.



My understanding is that in order to receive my cert III I must complete a further fifty hours at the D’Arcys office as well as finishing two more modules and one psychology class.



I would therefore greatly appreciate if Peter, Debbie and yourself would support the completion of my cert.



Kind regards,



Jill
